# RapidIdentity Studio: Overview

RapidIdentity Studio is a rostering solution that consolidates data from multiple sources—such as Student Information Systems (SIS), CSV files, or HR data—into a single “data warehouse.” Once the data is centralized, Studio allows extensive customization, enabling different applications to receive exactly the data they require.

### Key Capabilities

- **Multiple Source Integration**  
    Pull data from SIS (via OneRoster), custom CSVs, APIs, or other systems.
- **Data Consolidation**  
    Merge and store all user information in one place for consistent and accurate provisioning.
- **Flexible Rostering**  
    Send data to applications with custom mappings and filters—ensuring only the right users get rostered.

## Applications and Access Groups

### Adding Applications

1. **App Library**
    
    - Select a pre-built connector for popular platforms (e.g., McGraw Hill, Schoology).
    - Configure credentials (API keys/secrets or SFTP information).
2. **Custom Apps**
    
    - Create a new application from scratch to support proprietary CSV formats or unique vendor requirements.
    - Customize CSV definitions or field mappings as needed.

### Defining Access Groups

- **Purpose**: Control which users are sent to each application.
- **How It Works**
    - **Unrestricted Access**: Send all data from Studio to the specified application.
    - **Restricted Access**: Create one or more Access Groups to filter records by district, campus, role, course, and more.
    - **Logic**:
        - **Inside a Single Group**: All conditions (campus, course, role) use AND logic.
        - **Multiple Groups for the Same App**: Groups use OR logic to widen the selection.

## Data Explorer and Mappings

### Viewing Source and Target Data

- **Data Explorer** provides two important views:
    - **Raw Data**: Displays records exactly as they come from the source (SIS, CSV, etc.).
    - **Transformed Data**: Shows how data looks after merging and any expression-driven modifications.

### Field Mapping

- Each application can have unique field mappings or transformations.
- **Expressions** allow adding text, removing domains, or combining fields. For example, an email field might be generated by combining `username + "@district.org"`.

## Scheduling and Pipeline

### Setting Up Automatic Runs

- Schedule jobs (often nightly or once/twice daily) to:
    1. Import fresh data from all sources.
    2. Update the Studio data warehouse.
    3. Export updated records to each target application.

### Threshold Checks

- Configure thresholds to monitor record count changes or anomalies.
- If a threshold is exceeded, the system can pause for manual approval before proceeding.

---

## Notifications and Alerts

- **Email Alerts**:
    - Enable notifications for job failures, threshold approvals, or cancellations.
    - Specify any email addresses that should receive these alerts (not restricted to Studio administrators).

## Exporting and Importing Configurations

### Why It’s Useful

- **Configuration Cloning**: Easily replicate an existing application setup (minus credentials) to quickly launch a similar or new integration.
- **Testing Changes**: Export and import configurations to experiment without affecting a live production environment.

## Upcoming Features and Common Questions

- **OneRoster 1.2**: Official support is on the roadmap.
- **LTI 1.3**: Compatibility is also in development.
- **Extra Fields**: Studio can pull additional user details (such as LEP status, job codes, or sponsored accounts) to include in rosters as needed.
